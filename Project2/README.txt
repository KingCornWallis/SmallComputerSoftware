// This repository contains project 2 for CS 376 for Fall 2017.

The purpose of this project is become familiar with image manipulation-specifically, bitmaps via lockbits.

This program merges two images together over a period of time. Both the images and duration are provided bythe user.

The entire project has too many supporting files to be included on Github, only the parts
I programmed are included.

This project is implemented through C# WPF.
