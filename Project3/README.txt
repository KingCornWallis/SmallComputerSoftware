// This repository contains project 3 for CS 376 for Fall 2017.

The purpose of this project is become familiar with background workers and threads.

This is a simple computer 'benchmarking program' that tests single and multicore performance by multiplying double precision arrays.

This project is not working as expected.

The entire project has too many supporting files to be included on Github, only the parts
I programmed are included.

This project is implemented through C# WPF.
