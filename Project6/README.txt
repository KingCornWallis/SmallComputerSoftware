// This repository contains project 6 for CS 376 for Fall 2017.

The purpose of this project is become familiar with developing a game to be played on external hardware

This project features the game of Tetris, to be played on a GHI Electronics developmental board running the TinyCLR OS.

We were given approximately 3 weeks to complete this project, and the expectation was not to fully complete the game. My game does not feature any type of score system or row deletion, and the bounds checking system is flawed but working.

The entire project has too many supporting files to be included on Github, only the parts
I programmed are included.

This project is implemented through C# WPF.
